# Model metadata

This folder should contain metadata files for the models submitting to the hub, following the recommended [model metadata guidelines in our documentation](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format/model-metadata.html).

Since some metadata fields may be specific to this hub, creators of the hub are encouraged to modify the template model metadata file so that it is a valid model metadata file for your project.
